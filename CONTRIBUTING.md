# Contributing

## Licensing and provenance

Contributions are accepted under the **Developer Certificate of Origin** (DCO)
version 1.1, reproduced below. **Authors retain copyright in their
contributions.** There is no copyright assignment and no contributor licence
agreement.

**What you license by submitting a contribution:**

> By submitting a contribution to this repository, you license it under the
> GNU General Public License, version 3 only (`GPL-3.0-only`), together with
> the Additional Permission in [`LICENSE.EXCEPTION`](LICENSE.EXCEPTION),
> version 1.0 of 24 September 2026. You retain copyright.

The second half of that sentence is the point of it. Tiamat Default World
promises mod authors that a work interacting with it only through its exports,
the engine's scripting API or the network protocol is independent and carries
no copyleft obligation. That promise is worth exactly what every copyright
holder in the tree has granted, so a contribution licensed under the bare GPL
would leave a hole in it. Licensing under the GPL *with* the Additional
Permission closes that hole for the code you add, and your DCO sign-off is the
record of having done so.

One consequence worth stating plainly: because copyright stays with each author,
the project cannot be relicensed, and the text of the Additional Permission
cannot be changed for code you wrote, without your agreement. Iridesium
maintains the text and can amend it for its own code; a new version gets a new
number and date, and code contributed under an earlier version stays under that
version unless its author agrees otherwise. This is a deliberate trade —
contributor-friendly, and it makes licensing changes hard on purpose. If the
project ever needs a CLA, that decision has to be made before outside
contributions accumulate, not after.

Files within `stubs/`, and `AGENTS.md`, are vendored from the Tiamat engine's
`api/` and stay under the MIT licence they carry; a change to them belongs in
the engine first.

The same terms, with the same permission adapted to each work, apply in the
Tiamat engine and in each of Iridesium's default-mod repositories; the
checklist that keeps them identical is the engine's
`docs/licensing/mod-repo-checklist.md`.

### Sign-off is required

Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by` trailer matching its author:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

`git commit -s` adds it.

## Before you open a pull request

Run the checks:

```
cargo run -p server -- --check-mods <this repository's mods/>   # from the engine checkout
./scripts/check-spdx.sh
./scripts/check-dco.sh
```
